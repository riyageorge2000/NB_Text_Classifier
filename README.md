# NB_Text_Classifier using CountVectorizer
# Text Classifier using Naive Bayes and Streamlit

Description:
I created a Text Classifier using Naive Bayes and Streamlit that can predict the category of news headlines from the BBC dataset. The app is designed to classify news headlines into one of five categories: Tech, Business, Sports, Entertainment, or Politics. The model was trained using a labeled dataset of news headlines from the BBC and was saved as a pickle file for later use.

Instructions:
Access the Text Classifier Demo through the Streamlit link provided.
Enter the news headline you wish to classify into the input box.
Click the "Check Category" button to see the predicted category.

Technical details:
The app was built using Streamlit, a Python framework for building interactive web apps. The model uses a Naive Bayes classifier, a popular algorithm for text classification, and a CountVectorizer to transform the text data into numerical features. The app was trained on a preprocessed and labeled dataset of news headlines from the BBC, and it is able to classify new headlines into one of five categories with high accuracy. The model was saved as a pickle file for easy access and future use.
